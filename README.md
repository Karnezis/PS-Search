  <h3 align="center">PathoSpotter Search</h3>

  <p align="center">
    PathoSpotter is a computational tool built to help pathologists. It can be hard for a physician to remember where he or she has seen similar cases to a specific one. This is the first version of a content-based retrieval web module that can retrieve digital images of glomerulus by their similarity. The project was then improved in a private repository and published. The final version of this project won the <a href="https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/sibgrapi2021/awards.php#content">Best Work Award of the Workshop of Works in Progress</a>.</p>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As a physician, have you ever wondered "I have seen a case like this before, but where?". We made this tool to answer that question. PathoSpotter Search is a web module that searches for a query image in large folders of images. It will only cost you a few clicks.

### Built With

* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
* [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js?hl=pt-br)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Karnezis/PS-Search.git
   ```
2. In Visual Studio Code, simply add the Live Server extension in the market. Start it.

3. Access the website in the link specified.

## Usage

First, upload the folder you want to search into to our website, in the first step form. Don't worry, we never keep the files. We will return them to you as a JSON file. Then, you can upload that JSON file into the second step. Also, upload the query image. And define how many results you want to see. We will show you! _Ta-da!_
